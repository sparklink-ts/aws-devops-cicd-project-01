To deploy a Spring Boot application using AWS CodePipeline, the general process involves setting up a CI/CD workflow that sources your code, builds it, and deploys it to a target environment such as Amazon ECS.  

**Prerequisites:**

• An AWS account with administrator permissions. 
• A Spring Boot application (packaged as a JAR file) in a source repository like GitHub or AWS CodeCommit 
• The application should be configured to run with an embedded server like Tomcat and packaged as a "fat" JAR. 
• For containerized deployments (ECS), you will need a  Dockerfile and an  Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository. 


**Core AWS Services Used:** 

• AWS CodePipeline: Orchestrates the entire CI/CD process. 
• AWS CodeBuild: Compiles the source code, runs tests, and produces the deployment artifact (JAR file or Docker image). 
• Amazon ECS: The target environment where the application runs. 
• AWS CodeDeploy: Automates deployment to services like ECS (often integrated within the pipeline for non-containerized EC2/Beanstalk deployments).

**Step-by-Step Deployment (General Process):** 

**1.** Set up the Application Environment: Create the target environment where your application will run. This is often done using Amazon ECS for containerized microservices.

**2.** Configure Source Repository: Push your Spring Boot code to a version control system like  GitHub or  AWS CodeCommit
   
**3.** Create a CodeBuild Project: 

	• In the  AWS CodeBuild console , create a new build project. 
	• Link it to your source repository. 
	• Define a  file (placed in your source repository) that specifies the build commands, including a  command to move the resulting JAR        file to the root directory for Elastic Beanstalk compatibility, or to build and push a Docker image to  ECR 

**4.** Create the CodePipeline: 

	• In the  AWS CodePipeline console , create a new pipeline. 
	• Source Stage: Select your source provider (e.g., GitHub, CodeCommit) and repository. Configure webhooks to trigger the pipeline            automatically on code changes. 
	• Build Stage: Select AWS CodeBuild as the provider and choose the build project created in the previous step. 
	• Deploy Stage: Select your deployment provider like Amazon ECS. 
	• For a containerized deployment, choose  Amazon ECS and specify the cluster and service. 

**5.** Run the Pipeline: Once created, the pipeline will automatically start, pulling your code, building the artifact, and deploying the         application to your specified environment. 

**6.** Create the Load Balancer: 

	• For a Load Balancer service we have to create a Target Group and specify the ports and other configuration.
    • Create a Load Balancer service using the newly created Target Group and also specify the other configuration.

   It is used to distribute the traffic to your task. The load balancer redirects multiple instances of a microservice component (to scale    the deployment)

**7.** Create API Gateway:

   • Create a REST API Gateway
   • Create a  resource for that api gateway and provide the resource path and name.
   • Create a method for that resource, choose the method type and provide the endpoint URL which is the load balancers url or endpoint. 
   • Deploy the API with the stage name.	
	
	Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that helps to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications.
