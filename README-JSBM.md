To deploy a Spring Boot application using AWS CodePipeline, the general process involves setting up a CI/CD workflow that sources your code, builds it, and deploys it to a target environment such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Amazon ECS.  
Prerequisites 

• An AWS account with administrator permissions. 
• A Spring Boot application (packaged as a JAR file) in a source repository like  GitHub 
 or  AWS CodeCommit 
. 
• The application should be configured to run with an embedded server like Tomcat and packaged as a "fat" JAR. 
• For containerized deployments (ECS), you will need a  Dockerfile 
 and an  Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) 
 repository. 

Core AWS Services Used 

• AWS CodePipeline: Orchestrates the entire CI/CD process. 
• AWS CodeBuild: Compiles the source code, runs tests, and produces the deployment artifact (JAR file or Docker image). 
• AWS Elastic Beanstalk / Amazon ECS: The target environment where the application runs. 
• AWS CodeDeploy: Automates deployment to services like EC2 or ECS (often integrated within the pipeline for non-containerized EC2/Beanstalk deployments).

Step-by-Step Deployment (General Process) 

1. Set up the Application Environment: Create the target environment where your application will run. This is often done using  AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
 for simpler deployments or  Amazon ECS 
 for containerized microservices. 
2. Configure Source Repository: Push your Spring Boot code to a version control system like  GitHub 
 or  AWS CodeCommit 
. 
3. Create a CodeBuild Project: 

	• In the  AWS CodeBuild console 
, create a new build project. 
	• Link it to your source repository. 
	• Define a  file (placed in your source repository) that specifies the build commands, including a  command to move the resulting JAR file to the root directory for Elastic Beanstalk compatibility, or to build and push a Docker image to  ECR 
. 

4. Create the CodePipeline: 

	• In the  AWS CodePipeline console 
, create a new pipeline. 
	• Source Stage: Select your source provider (e.g., GitHub, CodeCommit) and repository. Configure webhooks to trigger the pipeline automatically on code changes. 
	• Build Stage: Select AWS CodeBuild as the provider and choose the build project created in the previous step. 
	• Deploy Stage: Select your deployment provider. 

		• For a simple JAR deployment, choose  AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
 and select your application and environment names. 
		• For a containerized deployment, choose  Amazon ECS 
 and specify the cluster and service. 

5. Run the Pipeline: Once created, the pipeline will automatically start, pulling your code, building the artifact, and deploying the application to your specified environment.
